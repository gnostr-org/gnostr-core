//
//    WEEBLE WOBBLE is a timestamping method using bitcoin blockheight, utc
//    time and a modulus function to create a unique, decentralized, yet
//    verifiable two part time stamp. weeble wobble was originally described in
// a    decentrailized version control proposal known as 0x20bf. The "weeble"
//    component of the time stamping method is simply floor(utc/block_height).
// The    wobble part of the time stamp is where weeble:wobble has more
//    interesting functionality. utc modulus block_height (utc % block_height).
//    utc mod block_height measures the time between bitcoin blocks and can be
//    adjusted to a varying granularity depending on specification needs.
//    weeble functions as a network "minute hand" and wobble functions as a
//    network "second hand" (for example) but can be adjusted to milliseconds
// etc...
